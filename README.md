Easy JWT Client removes the need to maintain and rebuild authentication for each application. By using the generic helper functions available through this package, authentication, user's actions, and token management can be abstracted away to provide a simple standard interface. This package can easily interface with [`ts-easy-jwt-auth`](https://github.com/Olencki-Development/ts-easy-jwt-auth) & [`redux-process`](https://github.com/Olencki-Development/redux-process) if desired.

npm install ts-easy-jwt-client --save
